# Fish Skin's Vibe Coding Zero-Basics Tutorial

Hello everyone, I'm programmer Fish Skin.

Nowadays, Vibe Coding has taken the internet by storm. Not just programmers, but even designers, product managers, operations specialists, and people with no technical background at all are using Vibe Coding to realize their ideas, creating products with AI and monetizing them.

To help everyone keep up with the times, I've single-handedly created a completely free and open-source [Vibe Coding Zero-Basics Tutorial](https://ai.codefather.cn/vibe)!

With thousands of images and hundreds of thousands of words, combining my 2.5 years of AI programming experience + project development experience + product monetization experience, I have just one goal: **Help anyone quickly master Vibe Coding. Even with zero background, you can rapidly develop and launch your own product to profitability.**

To brag a little, I dare say this free tutorial outperforms 90% of paid Vibe Coding content out there, given the amount of time I've invested.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Simply put, **Vibe Coding is chatting with AI in plain language to have it write code for you**. You don't need to memorize any syntax—just clearly articulate your requirements, like "Help me create an expense tracking page," and AI will generate it for you. Programming becomes as natural as having a conversation—that's the magic of Vibe Coding.

## Why Learn Vibe Coding?

In the past, learning programming took months. Now with Vibe Coding, you can get started in just a few days. Think of an idea today, build it today—productivity increases by orders of magnitude!

After learning Vibe Coding, you can quickly create tools to boost office efficiency, develop apps to solve everyday problems, and turn creative ideas into real, profitable products.

## What's in This Tutorial?

While there are many AI programming tutorials online, most are either too fragmented, only cover tools without methodology, or lack practical examples.

This leads to piecemeal learning—finding one trick here, another there—making it hard to systematically master Vibe Coding.

That's why I stepped in!

This tutorial covers every aspect of Vibe Coding. From zero basics => creating your first project in 10 minutes => learning multiple AI programming tools => hands-on projects => mastering core AI programming techniques => running through the entire product monetization process. Plus, it comes with AI programming learning resources, an AI knowledge base, and a troubleshooting manual to help you dominate Vibe Coding and handle any demand.
