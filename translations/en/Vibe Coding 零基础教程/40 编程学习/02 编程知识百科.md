# Programming Knowledge Encyclopedia

Hello, I'm Yupi, a former Tencent full-stack developer and an [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with over 2 million followers across platforms. I'm also the creator of over 10 self-developed products, including [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

When learning programming, we often encounter various concepts and technologies, such as "What is RESTful API?", "What is microservices?", "What is Docker?". Searching on the internet yields a plethora of articles, some too simplistic, others overly complex, leaving us still confused after reading.

To solve this problem, I created a **Programming Knowledge Encyclopedia** series on [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453/lists/6264323), explaining programming knowledge through anime, making it easy to understand even for beginners.
