## Why Create Interview Duck?

I believe programming friends all dislike rote memorization questions, which are relatively rigid with fixed answers. But **interviews inevitably test rote memorization**, so many friends often complain to me:

- Rote memorization is too hard! What if I forget after memorizing?
- There's too much rote memorization! Which parts should I focus on?
- Where can I find rote memorization materials? Online ones are too messy!
- There are many questions online, but the solutions are too shallow!
- Memorizing rote questions feels useless, I still don't know anything!

Indeed, although there are many organized interview question PDFs online, most are "used for traffic generation", either incomplete, not updated, or with varying solution quality. If you were to prepare for an interview now, wouldn't you first organize a set of interview questions, then search for many solutions online, and then filter them? It's troublesome and time-consuming, and most importantly, you don't know if the questions will be tested or if the solutions are correct, right?

The world has suffered from rote memorization for too long. **Friends, it's time to crush the interviewer!**

So we launched the interview question bank《Interview Duck》, with more comprehensive questions, more convenient practice, more time-saving memorization, higher quality solutions, richer knowledge, and more frequent updates, these are Duck Duck's 6 advantages. The goal is simple: **help everyone prepare for interviews in less time and crush the interviewer**!

Imagine how great it would feel to encounter a question you've prepared for during the interview~

Below introduces the advantages of Interview Duck, more recommended to watch the short video introduction: https://bilibili.com/video/BV14E421w7dr/

## Advantages of Interview Duck

### 1. Four-platform Synchronization, More Convenient Practice

First, Interview Duck supports **web, mini-program, IDE plugin, and VSCode plugin**, with full-platform data synchronization, truly enabling **practice anytime, anywhere**, easily preparing for job interviews.

Moreover, the interface is clean and very convenient to use, even during interviews you can secretly use it to search for questions...

Especially the "Immersion Mode", which hides other elements on the page with one click, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in practicing, one question after another, unstoppable.

The newly launched 【Specialized Practice】 and 【Test Yourself】 convert those high-frequency interview questions into multiple-choice questions, **specifically targeting those who seem to understand but fail when asked**.

Especially those concepts that are easily blurred, which knowledge is truly mastered, and which needs further consolidation, testing will clarify everything. Practicing this way often can also **help you understand the interviewer's question design**, making you more confident during interviews.

To help everyone happily slack off while practicing, we also launched Interview Duck IDE and VSCode plugins. The question bank and question list are displayed using native UI, **with sufficient stealth**! You can also customize shortcuts, open/close panels with one click, even if the second brother of the Calabash Brothers comes, he won't find out I'm slacking off practicing~

Don't waste time organizing questions and searching for solutions online anymore! **The time you waste, others can memorize many more questions.**

### 3. Higher Quality Solutions

We know that the efficiency of memorizing and practicing questions largely depends on the quality of the solutions, so we specially invited multiple **big company interviewers to create and optimize solutions**, ensuring the solutions are correct and easy to understand.

Take "How to Design XX System" type scenario questions as an example, if you don't have similar experience, you'll be clueless. We first give **key points** for the question, directly hitting the interviewer's weak spots, then provide more **extended knowledge** based on practical experience, delivering a combo to the interviewer. For example:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1768276824962-f8ecc421-0f5b-4e0d-b819-6a7c3767580e.png)

Just this one question Duck Duck wrote over 3000 words, accompanied by images to aid understanding, ensuring it's easy to understand. This way, everyone isn't just memorizing questions to cope with interviews, but **truly learning**, comprehensively improving technical vision, development ability, and interview experience.

Many of our solutions can be treated as technical articles and columns to learn from, so even if you're not urgently preparing for interviews now, you can understand high-frequency test questions, consolidate basic knowledge, clarify learning plans, and improve technical skills through Interview Duck.

For example, can you answer these questions below?

### 4. More Frequent Updates

We are now updating solutions at high speed every day while optimizing system functions. In the future, we will also follow interview trends, continuously update question banks and solutions, timely add new questions, new knowledge, new techniques from current enterprise interviews, keeping you always ahead, not wasting time on outdated questions and knowledge.

Currently all questions and question banks are free to view, but some solutions created by our big company interviewers are **members-only**, after all, original solutions and system development consume a lot of manpower.
