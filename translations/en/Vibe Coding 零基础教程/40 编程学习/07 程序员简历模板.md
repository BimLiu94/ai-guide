# Programmer Resume Template

> Get your resume done in 1 minute, make it more professional

Hello, I'm programmer Yupi.

Over 4 years of knowledge sharing, I've reviewed thousands of resumes for friends. Without exaggeration, most students' resumes can only be described as "painful to look at."

There are several most typical resume writing problems, such as:

- Resume is too short, not knowing what to write
- Resume layout is messy, overly flashy
- Professional skills section lacks professionalism
- Sentences in the resume are incoherent
- Resume contains typos

For students not urgently job hunting, don't think resume writing is irrelevant to you. If you can recognize these problems early and master resume writing techniques, you won't make a fool of yourself when job hunting.

As a programmer, seeing these problems always makes me ponder: Is there a way to automatically help people identify resume issues? Help everyone write better resumes faster?

To solve these problems, after researching over a dozen resume writing platforms, I decided to lead a team to develop a brand-new online resume creation website — **Old Fish Resume**!

## 1. Quick Resume Generation

Old Fish's first major capability is quick resume generation - helping you create a basic resume in under a minute.

We provide 3 ways to create a resume.

### 1. Resume Templates

An excellent resume focuses more on content; layout just needs to be clean and neat - no flashy designs.

Old Fish offers multiple clean, professional resume templates. With one click, you can create a neat and aesthetically pleasing resume without wasting time on formatting!

![Resume Templates](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E5%9C%881-20231122134518132.png)

Old Fish also provides resume templates for popular positions, with many ready-made resume content references to give you ideas and inspiration.

For example, the front-end internship resume template can be used with one click:

![Front-end Resume Template](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927132442244-20231122134518284.png)

### 2. AI Quick Resume Generation

Many first-time resume writers may be completely unclear about how to write a resume, feeling lost.

To address this, we developed an AI resume generation feature. Just fill in your target position and briefly introduce your basic information to quickly generate a job application resume!

![AI Resume Generation](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927133412261-20231122134518373.png)

The generated result includes filled-in sections for education, professional skills, and work experience:

![Generation Effect](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927133641303.png)

Note that AI-generated content isn't fixed. The more detailed information you provide, the better the result will be~

### 3. Import Resumes in Multiple Formats

I believe many students still write resumes in Word, but we strongly advise against submitting Word-format resumes as they may have formatting issues and are harder to maintain and update.

Old Fish Resume supports quick import of resume files in various formats like Word, PDF, JPG, PNG, Markdown, Doc, Html, etc., easily helping you "upload your resume to the cloud" for more convenient submission and sharing later~

## 2. Quick Resume Optimization

After creating a basic resume, the next step is to write and optimize it based on your actual situation.

Old Fish Resume provides various practical features to help solve common resume writing problems:

### 1. Real-time Resume Editing and Preview

First is an easy-to-use resume editor with editing on the left and real-time preview on the right. It also supports flexible style adjustments and one-click theme template switching, maximizing your resume writing experience~

### 2. Custom Resume Modules

Supports freely adding modules, rich text customization of content and format, meeting almost all your resume modification needs!

### 3. Smart Error Correction

As mentioned earlier, many students' resumes contain typos. Especially for technical positions, a single typo can greatly affect the interviewer's impression of you, potentially causing your resume to be rejected immediately!

To solve this, Old Fish Resume provides a one-click `Smart Error Correction` feature that not only helps quickly fix typos but also optimizes professional terms, capitalization, incorrect punctuation, and sentence coherence:

### 4. Smart One-Page

While there's no strict requirement for resume length to be one page, it's generally recommended to keep it to one page or ensure the first page best showcases your abilities and value.

But what if your resume is just slightly over one page?

Old Fish Resume offers a `Smart One-Page` feature to adjust resume layout with one click, automatically optimizing it to one page:

![Smart One-Page](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/cef2eaf8-39de-47bb-84a8-a69d8879a5a2-20231122134519390.png)

### 5. Resume Assistant

This is what we consider the most practical feature. Many students, lacking resume writing or practical experience, may have no idea how to write resume content.

To solve this, Old Fish Resume provides abundant `Resume Examples` and `Resume Tips` for various positions and sections, helping everyone quickly improve their resumes and learn resume writing techniques.

For example, quickly referencing professional skill examples:

![Resume Examples](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image%20(5)-20231122134519520.png)

Learning how to write professional skills well and common issues:

![Resume Tips](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image%20(6)-20231122134519691.png)

Don't underestimate resume writing techniques - sometimes, a single detail can significantly boost your resume!

For example, in Yupi's resume, he mentioned being responsible for the website construction studio during college and building multiple websites for the school, including real website links to greatly enhance the credibility of his experience. Similarly, it's best to provide project or documentation links for projects you've worked on.

![Resume Example](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927141549926-20231122134519763.png)

### 6. AI Resume Content Optimization

Every section supports AI optimization. With one click, AI helps quickly optimize resume content, making sentences more coherent, content more connected, and expressions more professional!
