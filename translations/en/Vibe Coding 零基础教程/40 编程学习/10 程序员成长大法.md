# Six Methods for Programmers to Grow Rapidly

> How to grow quickly at work and break through career bottlenecks

Hello, I'm Yupi the Programmer.

Another year has passed, and many of you have just entered the workplace, inevitably feeling anxious and confused about future growth.

Today, I want to discuss a very realistic issue: If you join an outsourcing company, or if your job itself doesn't bring you growth, how should you break through?

Run, run fast!

Just kidding. Since your job doesn't bring you growth, then learn on your own. Simply treat your job as a transaction of money and labor.

This issue is actually quite broad. Considering that many of you might not enjoy listening to empty theories, I'll directly share my own practices and what I've observed from some rapidly growing experts.

## 1. Read a Few Articles Every Day

Yes, read 2 to 3 articles daily. Not too many, just enough to build a habit.

But be selective in what you read. Don't read just anything.

What kind of articles? First, **industry trend** articles, which keep you up-to-date with the industry and allow you to discuss new topics with colleagues and interviewers. For example, if AI becomes popular, first understand whether AI will impact you. If it does, then learn about AI-related tools.

Next, **technical articles**, but always focus on areas related to your work. If you read 2 to 3 articles daily, how many is that in a year? Nearly 1,000 articles! Convert that into tutorials, and it could be dozens of tutorials. This will significantly boost your growth, and it's a very manageable task.

I've been doing this consistently. Even now that I run a company, I read even more articles because I need to understand not just industry trends and technology, but also products, project management, and even recruitment.

Where should you read these articles? The most recommended are **tech blogs from major companies**. I follow many tech teams, although their content might be quite advanced. There are also tech news, experience sharing, programming trends, and technical insights. My own account shares a bit of everything.

This year, we've also created a completely free AI discussion group. Feel free to drop by anytime: https://ai.codefather.cn

## 2. Continuously Learn New Technologies

If you can achieve the above, congratulations! You can now advance by increasing your daily learning time because some knowledge shouldn't be learned in fragments.

Try dedicating less than an hour daily to watch 2 to 3 tutorial episodes. Stick with it for a month, and you'll complete a course. If you can do this for 6 months in a year, you won't be left behind.

Here's an important point: **Being laid off doesn't mean being eliminated**. If you're laid off, it's not necessarily your fault. It could be due to poor company management or unethical practices. Don't let uncontrollable factors shake your confidence.

## 3. Review and Summarize

This is something I've always done, and it's quite simple:

Step 1: Record your daily work.

Fixed a bug today? Write it down—it takes less than a minute. Completed a feature? Document it, attach the file—it's that simple. I used to record this before leaving work each day.

Step 2: Monthly record of key tasks, completed work, and learning progress.

When I first started interning, I recorded daily. I didn't just note work content but also insights and gains. For example, after discussions with mentors, I had many thoughts, all of which I recorded.

Step 3: Semi-annual or milestone reviews.

These reviews are more comprehensive, documenting the experience, process, results, and pros and cons. After completing this, you won't repeat the same mistakes. Many companies require semi-annual or annual performance reviews. If you've already documented your progress, writing these reviews becomes a simple copy-paste task.

## 4. Organize Your Arsenal

What do you think is the biggest difference between someone with 3 years of experience and someone with 1 year?

Experience!

You can't say that someone with 3 years of experience has the same accumulated content as someone with 1 year. Even if the remaining 2 years were spent on CRUD, they should have become a CRUD master.

So why do some people with 3 years of experience still seem like they have only 1 year?

Because they might have worked for 3 years, but by the third year, they've forgotten everything from the first year. The system designs they worked on, the technologies they encountered—all forgotten.

In fact, I don't even remember the code I wrote a month ago.

**Accumulating experience is crucial for determining how far and how steadily you can progress in your career.**

How do you accumulate it?

### 1. Build Your Own Bug Library

Document the issues you've resolved. These can become valuable talking points during interviews.

### 2. Build Your Own Experience Library

Record your work tips and pitfalls, not just in programming but also in career experiences. For example, I've learned:

- Don't fully commit yourself to the company.
- Don't reveal all your cards.
- Don't let your boss think you've only got this much.
- You can be friends with colleagues, but maintain boundaries.

Some of these insights might not be universally applicable, but they are part of your personal growth.

### 3. Organize Your Knowledge Points

Record and organize all the knowledge points you've learned in fragmented form.

What are fragments?

Take the project knowledge fragments I've dissected for Programming Navigation as an example. Knowledge fragments are small, reusable pieces of knowledge that can be applied to any project.

For example, how to use the Ant Design Pro framework is a knowledge fragment. How to initialize a Java project is a simple knowledge fragment.

Why do I recommend organizing fragments?

First, it's simple. You just need to write down a small piece of knowledge, even if it takes only 5 minutes. This removes the burden of feeling like you need to write a lengthy article, making it easier to build a habit.

I have a quirky habit of "verbalizing" my thoughts. When I want to record something, I just pull out my phone and start talking, using voice-to-text to quickly jot it down. Some of my articles are actually transcribed from my ramblings. Those who've watched my live streams know that I can talk endlessly on any given topic.

Second, why break it into fragments? Because each fragment is reusable. When you start your own project, just open your list of knowledge fragments and see what you can apply. For example, can you add global permission management to this project? Can you add caching? If yes, just refer to the specific knowledge fragment to see how you did it before.

### 4. Accumulate Your Tool Library

What do you use to take notes? Write documents? Create mind maps?

These are all things you can organize.

For example, I often discover new tools while learning online. If I don't accumulate them, I might forget them when I actually need to use them.

Ideally, when you switch to a new computer, you should be able to quickly install all your commonly used tools, maximizing the utility of your tool library.

## 5. Share

This is truly my own experience, as you can see.

**Note: Sharing doesn't mean becoming a content creator!** Content creation might come later. When you've shared enough content, becoming a content creator will feel natural, not forced.

How to do it?

Remember the suggestions I mentioned earlier? By now, you probably have a lot of your own valuable content to share, such as:

1. Share your reviews and experiences.
2. Share your arsenal.
3. Share the knowledge points you've learned.
4. Help others by answering their questions.

If you do these four things consistently, even if you don't intend to become a content creator, you'll inevitably gain some followers and attention.

When I first started creating content, I shared nothing but interview questions. Why? Because I was job hunting at the time, and I was constantly reviewing these questions. Sharing them was just a byproduct of my own preparation, helping me reinforce my knowledge.

You'll notice that the growth methods I've mentioned follow a natural sequence—things you can do at work that will bring you growth. First, learn technology, continuously accumulate knowledge, then review and summarize, and finally, share what you've learned.

## 6. Learn to Break Down Goals

While doing the above, consistently practice **breaking down goals**.

When you realize that a big task seems daunting, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Split a large goal into smaller, more certain, and simpler tasks that you can tackle even in fragmented time.

For example, if you want to pass the English CET-4, break it down into daily tasks like memorizing 10 words, reviewing 50 words weekly, and reviewing 200 words monthly.

Sometimes, the reason we don't start is that the task seems too difficult. We worry that we can't complete it, or that work will get in the way. **Uncertainty often leads to inaction.**

Therefore, it's crucial to learn how to break down work and goals into clear, step-by-step plans. Even if you take a 7-day break, you can pick up where you left off and continue progressing.

If a task seems too hard, start with something simpler. If a small plan still feels daunting, break it down further. If watching a single lesson seems difficult, break it into daily 10-minute segments, completing a 40-minute lesson in 4 days. This ensures you make progress without feeling overwhelmed.

**The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.**

It's never too late to start, as many are starting even later than you. Start tomorrow, stick with it for 7 days, then try for 21 days. You'll definitely notice your progress.

That's all for my sharing on how programmers can improve themselves after starting work. I believe these methods aren't limited to programmers—they're applicable to any job. I hope this helps!
