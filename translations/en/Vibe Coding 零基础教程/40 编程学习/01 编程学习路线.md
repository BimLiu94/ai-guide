# Comprehensive Programming Learning Roadmaps

> 100+ learning paths, from zero to mastery in one go



Hello, I'm Yupi, a former Tencent full-stack developer and an [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with over 2 million followers. I'm also the creator of [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn), among 10+ self-developed products.

The biggest challenge in learning programming is not knowing what to learn or how to learn it. There are too many scattered tutorials online—learning a bit here and there often leads to mastering nothing and increasing confusion.

To solve this problem, I've created **100+ step-by-step programming learning roadmaps** on [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn), covering almost all mainstream programming directions to help you learn systematically and efficiently without detours!
