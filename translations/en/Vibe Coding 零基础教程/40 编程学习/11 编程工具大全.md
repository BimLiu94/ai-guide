Hello, I'm programmer Yupi.

In the [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn) community, I often see questions like: What tools should I use to draw flowcharts or architecture diagrams? Which code editor is recommended for beginners? Which AI tools are actually useful?

Getting stuck at the "finding tools" stage in daily work can be exhausting.
