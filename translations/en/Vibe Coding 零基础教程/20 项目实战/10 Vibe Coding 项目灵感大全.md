# Vibe Coding Project Inspiration Guide

Hello, I'm Fish Skin.

In this article, I will provide you with 100 project ideas suitable for Vibe Coding, covering personal tools, work efficiency, entertainment creativity, education, social interaction, and more. You can choose based on your interests and skill level.

## How to Choose the Right Project?

Before diving into project ideas, let's talk about how to choose the right project.

Many students get excited when they see project ideas but give up after a few days.

Why? Because they chose the wrong project.

### Three Principles for Choosing Projects

#### Principle 1: Start with Your Own Needs

The best projects solve your own problems. If you use it daily, you'll naturally be motivated to continue. For example, if you find existing expense tracking apps too complex, you can create a simple expense tracker. If you want to develop a study habit, you can create a check-in app.

#### Principle 2: Choose a Moderate Difficulty Level

The project shouldn't be too simple or too difficult. If it's too simple, you won't learn much; if it's too hard, you might give up. A good standard is: you roughly know how to do it, but there are some technical points you need to learn. This way, it's challenging but not overwhelming.

#### Principle 3: Quick Results

Choose projects that yield quick results. For example, a simple tool that can be built in a few days and used immediately. This will give you a sense of achievement and motivation to continue. Avoid projects that take months to see results.

### My Suggestions

If you're a complete beginner, start with personal tool projects. These projects are simple, use a single tech stack, and are easy to get started with. Examples include to-do lists, expense trackers, and Pomodoro timers.

If you've already completed a few projects, try work efficiency or education-related projects. These are slightly more complex and involve more features and interactions. Examples include note-taking apps, online whiteboards, and study check-ins.

If you want to challenge yourself, try social interaction or entertainment creativity projects. These involve user interaction, real-time communication, and other complex features. Examples include anonymous chat rooms, online games, and content communities.

### How to Validate Project Ideas

Once you have an idea, don't rush to start. First, validate whether the idea is worth pursuing.

Ask yourself these questions:

- Does this problem really exist?
- How many people have this need?
- What are the shortcomings of existing solutions?
- What are the advantages of my solution?

If the answers are all positive, then you can start.

You can also create a minimal viable product (MVP) first, implementing only the core features to see if it's truly useful. If it is, continue refining it; if not, pivot early.
