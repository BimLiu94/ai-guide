# Vibe Coding Project Practice Guide

> From 0 to 1: Building Real Projects


Hello, I'm Yupi, a former Tencent full-stack developer, and an [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across platforms. I'm also the creator of over 10 self-developed products, including [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

If you've already completed the 【Basic Essentials】section and successfully built your first web application, congratulations — you've taken the most crucial step in Vibe Coding!

But I guess you might be wondering:

"Building a simple to-do app feels rewarding, but it's still far from a usable product, right?"

"I want to work on a more complex project, but I don't know where to start..."

"Seeing those cool AI apps others have built, I want to try too, but I feel lost."

Don't worry, these thoughts are completely normal. This section is specifically designed to address these concerns.



## 1. Why Build Projects?

Before answering "how to build projects," I want to talk about "why build projects."

Many students, after completing basic tutorials, start frantically learning various tools and technologies but never complete a full project. The result? They learn a lot but feel like they can't do anything.

**Building projects is the only true measure of learning.**

More importantly, in the era of Vibe Coding, the barrier to building projects has never been lower. You don't need to master every technical detail; you just need to:

1. Know what you want to build
2. Be able to clearly articulate your requirements
3. Use AI tools to implement them

You've already learned these three points in the 【Basic Essentials】section. Now, it's time to apply these skills to more challenging projects.



## 2. What Will This Section Cover?

The core content of this section includes **the complete project development process** and **various types of project practices**.

First, I'll introduce a proven standard development process, from idea to implementation, to make your project development more structured. This is the foundation of successful projects, and I strongly recommend starting with this part.

Then, I'll guide you through hands-on projects of various types. Starting with simple personal tools, such as portfolio websites, to-do apps, and Markdown note-taking apps, these projects are practical and beginner-friendly. Next, we'll dive into popular AI applications, including chat assistants, writing assistants, and image generators, helping you master the core skills of AI app development. Following that, we'll tackle more complex full-stack applications, such as blog systems, Q&A communities, and online stores, learning how to handle front-end, back-end, and databases. We'll also cover WeChat Mini Program development, from development to launch.

Once the project is complete, you'll learn how to deploy it. I'll teach you various deployment methods, from the latest AI auto-deployment to the popular Vercel one-click deployment, and even professional server deployment, making your project accessible to the world.

Finally, if you're unsure what project to build, I've prepared 100 project ideas for you to choose from — there's something for everyone.

Additionally, this section includes some extended content, such as enterprise project development processes, more enterprise-level AI project introductions, and Yupi's original project tutorials, which you can selectively learn based on your needs.



## 3. How to Use This Section?

You don't need to go through all the articles in this section; you can choose flexibly based on your situation.

If you're a complete beginner, I recommend starting with 《Vibe Coding Project Development Process》 to understand the basic methods of project development. Then, begin practicing with personal tool development, selecting a simple project to work on. This gradual approach will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.

If you're particularly interested in a specific area, you can jump directly to the corresponding chapter. For example, if you're interested in AI applications, you can dive straight into AI app development; if you want to build Mini Programs, you can go directly to the Mini Program development content. Each article is relatively independent, so you can understand it without reading the preceding content.

If you're unsure what project to build, you can start by browsing the Project Inspiration List, which contains 100 project ideas to spark your creativity.

For those looking to dive deeper, after completing basic projects, you can continue with 《Enterprise Project Development Process》 to understand how real-world commercial projects are developed. Or follow [Yupi's Original Projects](https://www.codefather.cn/post/1797431216467001345), where you'll find complete video and text tutorials for building enterprise-level projects.



## 4. What Will You Gain from This Section?

Through the learning and practice in this section, you will be able to:

1. Master a complete project development process
2. Independently complete the journey from idea to product
3. Build at least 2 ~ 3 showcase-worthy projects
4. Understand how to use AI to solve real-world problems
5. Establish confidence and methodology in project building

More importantly, you'll discover: **Building projects can be so simple and fun!**



## Final Words

I know that seeing the words "Project Practice" might make some students feel a bit nervous. But trust me, with the help of Vibe Coding, building projects is really not as hard as you might think.

Remember what I said in the 【Basic Essentials】section? Today, in 2025, is the easiest time in human history to learn programming. And the same goes for building projects.

You don't need to be a technical expert, nor do you need to memorize all the code syntax. You just need:

- An idea of what you want to build
- The ability to clearly articulate your requirements
- The willingness to experiment and iterate

You already have these three things.

So, are you ready? Let's embark on this exciting journey of project practice together!

You've got this! 💪
