# AI Creative Application - Internet Digital Graveyard Project

This project is an interesting Internet Digital Graveyard website, commemorating those once glorious but now closed internet products, including Kaixin001, Qvod, Qianqian Jingting, Tudou, and more.

This article does not cover the development process but shares a typical AI creative application case to help broaden your thinking.

Hello everyone, I'm programmer Yupi, and I'd like to share a somewhat interesting project. I used AI to create an `Internet Digital Graveyard`! It commemorates those once glorious internet products.

This idea came to me quite suddenly. A few days ago, while surfing the internet, I stumbled upon Renren and discovered that it officially ceased service in December 2024. Suddenly, I felt a mix of emotions. Thinking back to when I was a primary school student, I registered on Renren just to play Happy Farm, setting alarms every day to steal crops. That kind of joy is probably something today's Gen Z and Gen Alpha will never experience.

Then I started wondering, how many websites and apps that once accompanied us have silently disappeared over the years? These digital memories deserve a place to be preserved. That's when I came up with the idea — to create a digital graveyard specifically for recording these closed internet products.

The entire website, from design to material collection and development, was completely made using AI, all within an hour. I chose the graveyard theme, with a black and gray color scheme, and added subtle animations to create a commemorative atmosphere.

Honestly, the result turned out better than I expected. So, I deployed it online and even got a domain: https://gualeme.cn (which translates to "Is it down?"). Feel free to visit it; it might stir some memories in you.

The website catalogues various domestic and international websites and apps that closed between 2009 and 2024, sorted by year. Each product has a brief introduction and its specific "date of death."

For example, let me mention a few classic domestic products that truly represent the memories of a generation.

## Classic Product Reviews

### Renren

As the Chinese version of Facebook, how much of the youth of the 80s and 90s did it carry? Back then, I played various mini-games on it tirelessly. The social interactions were simple and pure. Unfortunately, it officially bid farewell on December 2, 2024.

### Qianqian Jingting

This was the first music player I ever used. I still remember the first song I listened to on it was "Far Away." Its simple interface and the then cutting-edge lyric synchronization feature accompanied many students' lives. After being acquired by Baidu in 2013 and renamed Baidu Music, it continued in another form, but the pure Qianqian Jingting era truly ended.

### Tudou

Founded in 2005, Tudou coined the slogan "Everyone is the director of their life." In an era without TikTok or Kuaishou, Tudou was our main platform for sharing videos and showcasing creativity. It was also the first platform I ever uploaded a video to. I remember uploading short skits and game recordings, hoping for views to surpass 10.

After 2012, Tudou merged with Youku, and in 2017, it was completely absorbed by Youku. From an independent brand to complete disappearance, Tudou's decline took several years. It's likely that kids today have never heard of it.

### Tencent Weibo

Launched in 2010, it quickly gained traction with QQ's massive user base. In 2011, its registered users even surpassed Sina Weibo. However, the rise of WeChat completely changed the game. Tencent realized that WeChat better aligned with its strategic layout, so Tencent Weibo was strategically abandoned. By 2014, it was essentially in a "vegetative state," and it wasn't until 2020 that it officially announced the cessation of services.

### Qvod

Among all the closed products, Qvod might be the most lamentable. In April 2014, the Qvod servers were shut down, and relevant personnel were sentenced. As for why it closed and the sentencing, I won't elaborate; those who know, know. Technologically, Qvod was indeed innovative, but it was misused.

## Final Thoughts

There are other websites like China Mobile's Fetion, Xiami Music, and Tianya Community, which I won't delve into. Each vanished product has its own story. Although they have declined, their marks on the history of the internet are indelible, and they carry the youth of our generation.

Although this project is simple, it showcases an important application scenario of AI programming — quickly realizing creative ideas. When you have a good idea, you don't need to spend a lot of time learning complex technologies. Just use AI tools to turn your idea into reality in a short time.

I hope this case inspires you, showing that AI programming isn't just for serious commercial projects but can also be used to realize various interesting ideas. Perhaps the next hit creative application will be made by you?

Did these websites stir any memories for you? Which product do you think is the most regrettable? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments!
