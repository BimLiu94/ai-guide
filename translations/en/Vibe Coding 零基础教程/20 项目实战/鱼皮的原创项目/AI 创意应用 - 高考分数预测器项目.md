The college entrance exam is approaching, but unfortunately, I won't be able to participate this year due to other commitments. So, I decided to help all the examinees by gifting them a tool I created—the **College Entrance Exam Score Predictor**!

Ta-da! Here it is, the **College Entrance Exam Score Predictor**!

Experience it here: [https://gaokao.codefather.cn](https://gaokao.codefather.cn/)

This is a futuristic AI technology that can predict your college entrance exam scores. Does it sound impressive? Or perhaps a bit outrageous?

Come on, test whether you'll get into Tsinghua University or Peking University? Or maybe a 985/211 university? Or perhaps... Bilibili University?

**Recommended to watch the video demo for a better experience:** [https://bilibili.com/video/BV1wqTTzoEoo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wqTTzoEoo)

There are 4 prediction methods, each of which is mind-blowing.

First, let's try the **Scientific Prediction**, which sounds very scientific. This is an accurate prediction based on big data analysis and machine learning algorithms, using a multi-dimensional subject ability assessment model combined with statistical analysis and probability theory calculations, with an error rate of no more than 0.001%. The testing method is simple: you just need to input your **expected score for each subject** and click "Start Scientific Prediction." The system will then use advanced **Arithmetic addition** (yes, that's **addition**) combined with normal distribution theory for precise calculations.

Let's give it a try!

How about it? Isn't the prediction accurate? It predicts that I can get into a top-tier university—Tsinghua University!

If I had this tool back when I took the college entrance exam, wouldn't I have been unstoppable?

You can also download a high-resolution certificate image, whether to share your joy with friends and family or to be the brightest star on your social media feed. This is another magical feature of the score predictor.

Next, let's try the **Metaphysical Prediction**. Metaphysics is a mysterious field—you believe it or you don't. This prediction combines ancient wisdom with modern divination, inheriting techniques like Zi Wei Dou Shu, Qi Men Dun Jia, and the I Ching, along with modern astrology and blood type psychology to predict your fate and academic fortune. Come on, input your name, zodiac sign, blood type, Chinese zodiac, and most importantly, your birth date!

“

Heaven and Earth, the universe vast,

The Big Dipper, the Southern Dipper,

The Five Elements, the Eight Trigrams,

Yin and Yang, the cosmos rotates!

The Three Powers established, the Four Symbols clear,

The Six Jia Generals, the Nine Palaces Flying Stars!

By the decree of the Supreme Lord Lao,

The Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, show your power!

”

Wow, the result is Tsinghua University again. I guess it's just my destiny!

Now, let's try my most proud creation—the **Quantum Mechanics Prediction**, based on the Schrödinger equation and wave function theory, using quantum entanglement principles to analyze probabilities across multiple universes, breaking the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional predictions.

Just click the button to start the quantum computing engine, determining the distribution of your college entrance exam score across multiple universes through wave function collapse.

As expected, Tsinghua University again! It's truly destiny! (I swear I added random logic in the program)

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138273388-e579158e-cd4a-45a4-bde4-0551c815b493.png)

Let's take a look at the detailed analysis. Turns out my learning state is in a superposition, my potential fluctuates quantumly, I'm the legendary top student, and I'm the light of prestigious universities!
