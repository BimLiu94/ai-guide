# Spring AI - AI Super Agent Project in Action

This project is a comprehensive AI super agent tutorial that guides you through developing an AI Love Master application and a super agent with autonomous planning capabilities. Through this project, you'll master the essential AI concepts, practical tools, programming techniques, framework principles, and optimization skills that modern programmers must know.

The project combines manual coding with Vibe Coding, integrating AI through Java backend + Spring AI code while using AI tools like Cursor to assist in coding. The focus is on learning enterprise AI application development, core concepts and implementation principles of AI agents, ReAct patterns, tool invocation, MCP, and other cutting-edge technologies.

Ideal for students with some project experience who want to systematically learn AI agent development and enhance their resumes with AI projects to boost competitiveness.

💡 The project is quite challenging, including video tutorials (dozens of hours), written tutorials (over 100,000 words), and ready-made resume writing and interview solutions. Completing it is expected to take 20+ hours, so it's not recommended for those without backend programming experience.

## Project Introduction

A project tutorial centered around **AI development**, guiding you through developing an **AI Love Master application + a super agent with autonomous planning capabilities**, helping you master the essential AI concepts, practical tools, programming techniques, framework principles, and optimization skills that modern programmers must know, significantly boosting your job competitiveness!

The `AI Love Master application` relies on AI models to solve users' emotional problems, supporting multi-turn conversations, Q&A based on custom knowledge bases, and autonomous tool invocation and MCP services to complete tasks, such as calling map services to find nearby locations and plan dates.

### 2. Project Benefits

This project features a novel theme and real-world business scenarios, standing out from the typical CRUD projects. Yupi will guide you through practical applications of many new technologies and enterprise scenarios, using a single tutorial to cover all the **essential AI technologies** programmers must know, helping you become a sought-after talent in the AI era and significantly boosting your resume and job competitiveness.

Yupi teaches **universal project development methods and architectural design patterns**. From this project, you'll learn:

- Usage of mainstream AI application platforms
- 4 ways to integrate AI models
- AI development frameworks (Spring AI + LangChain4j)
- Local deployment of AI models
- Prompt engineering and optimization techniques
- Spring AI core features: custom Advisor, conversation memory, structured output
- RAG knowledge base in practice, principles, and optimization techniques
- PgVector vector database + cloud database services
