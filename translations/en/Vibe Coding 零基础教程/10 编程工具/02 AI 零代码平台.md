# AI Zero-Code Platform

> Create applications directly in your browser, the simplest way of Vibe Coding

Hi, I'm Yupi.

If you're a complete beginner or just want to quickly validate an idea, then a **zero-code platform** is definitely your best choice.

Why is that?

Because zero-code platforms have three huge advantages:

1. No software installation required: Just open your browser and start using it
2. No coding knowledge needed: Describe your requirements in natural language
3. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG): See the effects immediately after making changes, and deploy with one click

In this article, I'll introduce several mainstream zero-code platforms in detail, focusing on the domestic Baidu Miaoda platform, and teach you how to choose and use them.

## 1. What is a Zero-Code Platform?

Before introducing specific tools, let's clarify: What is a zero-code platform?

Simply put, **a zero-code platform is an AI programming tool that you can use directly in your browser.**

You just need to describe your requirements in natural language, and the AI will generate a complete application for you, which can be previewed and modified in real-time.

The difference from traditional development:

Isn't it much simpler? This is the charm of zero-code platforms.

### Suitable Scenarios

Zero-code platforms are particularly suitable for:

- Complete beginners: Haven't learned programming yet, want to get started quickly
- Rapid prototyping: Need to quickly validate an idea
- Simple applications: Personal websites, landing pages, simple tools
- Learning experience: Want to experience the feeling of Vibe Coding first

Of course, zero-code platforms also have limitations. For particularly complex projects, a code editor might still be necessary. But for most scenarios, zero-code platforms are already powerful enough.

After understanding the basic concepts of zero-code platforms, I'll introduce several mainstream platforms in detail. Each platform has its own features and advantages, and I'll demonstrate their usage with practical examples to help you find the one that suits you best.

## 2. Bolt.new - Super-Fast Prototyping Tool

Bolt.new is currently one of the hottest zero-code platforms, launched by StackBlitz. Its biggest feature is **speed**, taking just about 1 minute from idea to seeing the result.

Core advantages of Bolt.new:

1. Extremely fast: Code generation and preview are both quick
2. Real-time preview: See changes as you make them, WYSIWYG
3. One-click deployment: Supports deployment to platforms like Netlify
4. Auto-fix: AI automatically detects and fixes errors

### How to Use Bolt.new?

> 💡 We've already learned how to use Bolt.new in the [Basic Must-Read] Quick Start Tutorial, so you can skip this part.

Using Bolt.new is very simple. I'll demonstrate with a practical example, such as creating a simple Pomodoro timer.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://bolt.new) and enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me create a Pomodoro timer with the following features:
- Default 25-minute countdown
- Start, pause, and reset buttons
- Notification sound when time is up
- Clean and modern interface
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110501086.png)

2) Wait for the AI to generate the code

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110607536.png)

3) See the real-time effect in the preview area on the right

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110658047.png)

4) If not satisfied, continue the conversation to adjust. Or use the visual editing feature to click and modify~

```
Change the background color to light blue and the buttons to rounded corners
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110744960.png)

5) Once satisfied, click the "Publish" button to deploy with one click, and you'll get a shareable link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111103207.png)

It's that simple! The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.

### Pros and Cons of Bolt.new

Bolt.new is suitable for quickly validating ideas or creating simple demos, and it's very fast. The learning curve is also low, requiring no coding knowledge at all—just the ability to speak. And you can see the generated code, which you can study if you want to learn. Finally, deploying the website is also simple, with just one click to go live, and you'll get a shareable link.

However, if the project is particularly complex, such as requiring complex backend logic or database operations, Bolt.new can still do it, but the results might not be as good. Although you can adjust the website through conversation, for very detailed customization, it might not be as flexible as writing code directly. Also, it must be used on the web, and the code editing experience is average.

### Pricing

- Free version: Limited usage, suitable for experience and learning
- Paid version: Around $25 per month, removes limitations

If you're a beginner, start with the free version to experience the charm of Vibe Coding. Once you're sure you want to dive deeper, consider paying.

## 3. Lovable - Full-Stack Application Builder

Lovable is a powerful zero-code platform that can not only handle the frontend but also build full-stack applications: including frontend, backend, database, and even user authentication!

Core advantages of Lovable:

1. Full-stack capability: Can create complete web applications
2. Database integration: Built-in Supabase for data storage
3. User authentication: Supports login, registration, etc.
4. High code quality: Generated code is well-structured and easy to maintain

### How to Use Lovable?

Let me demonstrate with a more complex example. Suppose I want to create a simple expense tracking app that requires login functionality.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://lovable.dev) and log in with GitHub or email

2) Enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me create an expense tracking app with the following features:
- User login and registration
- Add income and expense records
- Display total income, total expenses, and balance
- Filter records by date
- Data should be saved to a database
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111601472.png)

3) Lovable will then generate a complete full-stack application, including:

   - Frontend interface (React)
   - Backend API
   - Database schema (Supabase)
   - User authentication system

During this process, you might need to manually confirm some operations, such as enabling Cloud to support database and user authentication:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111715955.png)

4) After a few minutes, the AI finishes generating, and you can test the features in the preview area

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112144754.png)

5) Continue optimizing details through conversation and visual editing, the editing experience is still good

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112259442.png)

6) Deploy with one click

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112411553.png)

### Pros and Cons of Lovable

If your project requires backend, database, and user systems, Lovable is a good choice for building more complex full-stack applications.

The generated code is also well-organized, making it easier to export and maintain yourself. Plus, it directly integrates Supabase, a powerful backend service, allowing you to easily handle complex functions like data storage and user authentication.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112431787.png)

Of course, because it's more powerful, it's also relatively more complex, and beginners might need some time to adapt. Also, since it generates more code (frontend + backend), it might be slower than Bolt.new.

### Pricing

- Free version: Limited usage
- Paid version: Around $25 ~ $50 per month

If you're building a complete web application that requires a database and user system, Lovable is a great choice. But if you're just creating a simple showcase page, Bolt.new is sufficient.

## 4. Baidu Miaoda - Domestic Zero-Code Platform

Baidu Miaoda is an AI no-code application building platform launched by Baidu, and one of the most successful zero-code platforms in China.

Miaoda's biggest feature is that it not only generates applications but also enables direct commercialization. It has built-in payment functionality (including WeChat Mini Program payments) that can be directly integrated without additional development. Plus, the interface is entirely in Chinese, making it particularly user-friendly for domestic users.

### How to Use Baidu Miaoda?

Using Miaoda is very simple, just like other zero-code platforms:

1) Visit the [Baidu Miaoda official website](https://www.miaoda.cn/), register an account, and log in

2) Describe your requirements in Chinese:

```
Create an online booking system where users can select a date and time, fill in contact information, and submit a booking
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112754177.png)

3) Next, enter the development phase, and the AI might confirm requirements through conversation.

If you want to create a commercial-grade project, communicate carefully with it; if you're just making a demo for fun, skip the conversation directly.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112932144.png)

Then the AI generates a requirements document:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113021068.png)

You can manually edit the document or immediately generate the application.

After waiting a few minutes, the AI automatically generates a complete application, and you can preview the effect in real-time:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113641264.png)

5) Like other platforms, you can modify the application. It supports visual editing, and the editing experience is still good.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113743213.png)

6) Once satisfied, you can directly publish it and get an access link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113853665.png)

7) If you need more capabilities, you can use plugins to extend functionality, such as integrating WeChat Pay for charging

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113922034.png)

### Pros and Cons of Baidu Miaoda

Miaoda's biggest advantage is its Chinese-friendly interface, requiring no knowledge of English. Plus, its commercialization capabilities are strong, with built-in payment functionality that allows you to directly create paid applications, with many successful cases to reference.

But in my tests, compared to foreign platforms, the generated results are relatively average, suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

However, for domestic users, especially those looking to create mini-programs or quickly commercialize in the domestic market, Miaoda is a good choice.

## 4. Other Zero-Code Platforms Worth Noting

## 5. AI Application Development Platforms

Besides the zero-code platforms introduced above, there are also platforms specifically for developing AI applications, such as Dify, Coze, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, etc.

Their positioning is different from zero-code platforms like Bolt.new. Bolt.new is mainly used to generate regular websites and applications, while AI application development platforms are mainly used to build AI chatbots, AI knowledge base Q&A, AI workflows, and other applications that require AI capabilities.

In short, if you're creating regular websites or applications (like personal homepages, e-commerce sites), Bolt.new or Baidu Miaoda is sufficient. If you're creating AI applications (like smart customer service, AI assistants, knowledge base Q&A systems), you can try Dify or Coze.

![Dify Developing AI Applications](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1743561915955-ad27735a-c927-4207-b769-03fda32081b6.png)

These platforms provide visual configuration interfaces, allowing you to build AI workflows through drag-and-drop, creating powerful AI applications without writing code.

## 6. How to Choose a Zero-Code Platform?

By now, you might be asking: With so many platforms each having their own strengths, which one should I choose?

Actually, the choice is simple, mainly depending on your needs and personal situation.

1) Choose based on needs

If you're a domestic user looking to create mini-programs or need commercialization, Baidu Miaoda is the first choice, as it's Chinese-friendly and has built-in payment functionality, with hundreds of thousands of successful commercial application cases.

If you need to quickly create prototypes or simple pages, Bolt.new is fast and easy to use, showing results in 1 ~ 2 minutes. If you need to create complete web applications requiring databases and user systems, Lovable is a better choice, as it's the most powerful.

2) Choose based on personal situation

If you're a complete beginner (never written code), start with Baidu Miaoda or Bolt.new, as they're the simplest and easiest to use. If you have some basics (learned some programming), try Lovable, as it's more powerful and can create more complex things.

My suggestion is to start with Baidu Miaoda or Bolt.new, then gradually try other platforms based on your needs.

## 7. Zero-Code Platform Practical Tips

During my use of zero-code platforms, I've summarized some practical tips to share with you.

1) Be specific in describing requirements

Don't just say "create a website," but describe in detail, such as "create a personal portfolio website, including a homepage (large title + introduction + avatar), project showcase (card layout), contact information, with a clean and modern style using a blue color scheme." The more specific your requirements, the closer the AI-generated result will be to your expectations.

2) Implement in steps

Don't make too many requests at once, but proceed step by step. First, build the basic framework, then add features, and finally optimize details. This makes it easier to control progress and discover and fix issues.

3) If you have reference designs, you can upload images for the AI to reference, generating UI that better meets expectations.

4) After each AI code generation, always test in the preview area. For example, click all buttons to see if functions work, check effects on different screen sizes, input test data to see if displays are correct. If issues are found, immediately ask the AI to fix them, don't wait until problems pile up.

5) Before making major changes, it's best to save the current version. Most platforms support version history, allowing you to revert if something goes wrong.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107114739910.png)

6) Finally, even if you don't understand code now, you can export and save the generated code. When you learn later, you can revisit and study how this code was written.

## Final Words
